I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this\nmail private and also to kindly respect the integrity of the\ninformation you come by as a result of this email. I contacted you\nindependently of our investigation and no one is informed of this\ncommunication; I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I\nbelieve would be of interest to you. it is of great importance for you\nto take care and understand every word which I have written down\nbelow; please be patient and read the explanation in my email.\nIn 2006, the subject matter; Ref: HI/DSB/453/4 03/05 70 came to our\nbank to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking\nServices Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio\nof USD$18,991,674 million United States Dollars, which he wished to\nhave us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned\nto his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the\nde-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services\nDepartment, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into\nour bank.\nFew months later his attention was needed regarding a business which i\nwas going to discuss with him but i was unable to reach him, I made\nfutile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating\nhim to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days\nlater, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead,\na person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart\nattack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather\nmore information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank\nimmediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of\nkin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his\nfunds. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who\npatronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels\nof detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he\nlisted no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an\naccount with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are\nrarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the\naccounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of\nhaving their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring\nthat there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they\nnominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not\nnominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our\ncare, in this case; he died Intestate..\nThere is USD$18,991,674(eighteen million, nine hundred and ninety one\nthousand, six hundred and seventy four united states dollars)\ndeposited, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the\ndeposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. Also I alone know\nof the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm is\nconcerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I\nsent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation\nto the file are just customer services and due process. The finance\nfirm has no single idea of what's the history or nature of the\ndeposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit\nto any party that comes forward, and this is the situation. This bank\nhas spent great amounts of money trying to track the family of the\ndeceased; they have investigated for months and have found no family\nbut however the investigation has officially come to an end.\nMy proposal; I am prepared and ready to place you in a position\nwhereby an instruction is given to the finance firm to officially\nrelease the deposit to you as the closest surviving\nrelation/associate, and all etiquette shall be done in accordance with\nthe rule of law, I certainly can guarantee you that. By the common\nlaw, the power of bequeathing is coeval with the first rudiments of\nthe law. There is no ruling which prevents an inheritance from being\nso exhausted by legacies as to render it unworthy of the theirs\nacceptance; perfect operation whereby the paper work shall be\nco-ordinated in such a way that your status as a sole beneficiary is\nconfirmed. Upon receipt of the deposit, I will share the money with\nyou in half and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the\nnext of kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we\nshare the proceeds 50/50.\nI would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that\nwould have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming\nthe deposit, but on the other hand, you as a indifferent foreigner\nwould easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim, I\nassure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few\ndays. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file\nrelating to the customer If you find yourself interested to work with\nme, please contact me specifically, if you give me positive signals, I\nwill initiate this process towards a quick conclusion. It is necessary\nto inform you that under no condition should you contact me via\nofficial channels; I will simply deny knowing you and about this\nproject. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through our\nofficial lines neither do I want you contacting me through my official\nemail account. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My\nofficial lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored\nto assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality\nManagement policy, please observe this instruction religiously.\nPlease, again, note I am a Family woman; I am married with kids, I\nsend you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the\nconsequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is\nnothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a\nplatter of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private\nbanking clients; do not betray my confidence.
