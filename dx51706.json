My\nname is Mrs. Elizabeth J. GLIBERT is a nationality of the United\nStates of America. I am married to MR.GLIBERT ANTHONY who worked with\nKuwait Petroleum Corporation in the United Kingdom for nine years\nbefore he died in the year 2014. We were married for eleven years\nwithout a child; he died after a brief illness that lasted for only\nfour days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.\nWhen my late husband was alive we deposited the sum of $18.5 million\n(Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a BANK in\nEurope Presently, this money is still with the BANK. Recently, my\nDoctor told me that I would not last for the next one or two months\ndue to a long term cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my\nstroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to\nchurch or better still a Christian individual that will utilize this\nmoney the way I am going to instruct herein. I want you to use this\nfund for churches, orphanages, Research centers and widows propagating\nto the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.\nThe Bible made us understand that blessed is the hand that gives. I\ntook this bold decision because I don\u2019t have any child that will\ninherit this money and my husband\u2019s relatives are not Christians and I\ndon\u2019t want my family's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.\nI don\u2019t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly\nmanner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.\nI am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I\nam going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the\nlord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. With God all things\nare possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall detail you more\nand I will give the contact of the BANK as soon as I am sure that you\nwill do the will of God. I will also issue you a letter of authority\nthat will empower you as the new beneficiary of this Fund. I want you\nto always pray for me because the lord is my Shepherd. My happiness is\nthat I lived the life of a worthy Christian.\nWhoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and\ntruth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in\nyour reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Christian\nindividual for this same purpose.
