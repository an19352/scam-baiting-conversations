Please read carefully and patiently.\nIn June 2015, one of our foreign customers made a Fixed deposit for 36 calendar months, valued at US$35,500,000.00 in our bank where l am head of accounts department.\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After waiting several months, we sent a reminder and finally discovered from his contract employers that he and his family died in a plane crash.\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without leaving a WILL and all attempts to trace extended members of his family were never successful. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents in his Bank Deposit paperwork at my Bank.\nHis money (US$35,500,000.00 ) has been floating as unclaimed since maturity and all efforts to get his relatives have proved unsuccessful. According to our banking policy, if such money continues to remain unclaimed, the money will be passed to the coffers of the Central bank treasury unclaimed bill.\nIt's been many years now and nobody has shown up for the money. My proposal to you is that l want you to cooperate with me to enable us to claim the money so we can both use it for investment . I will put all the necessary documents together to make you the next of kin so that the money will be paid to you. I have secured from the probate court an order of mandamus to locate any family member of the deceased so that the money can be paid to him or her, but still no success.\nIf you agree to cooperate with me, after successful execution of this deal, we shall share the money in percentage of 50/50. I assure you that this deal is 100% risk free, you don't have to fear anything as l am a professional in Real Estate Banking / Family Wealth\nIf you are interested in engaging in this deal, please respond in earliest upon reception of this message so I can confidently explain to you more\nThank you.\nSincerely yours,\nJean-Jacque Kwame\n", "From: m*********e@naver.com\nTo: mr84654@l******s.email\nTime: 2023-04-15 10:50:35\nSUBJECT: Re: Attn: Hilary\nDear Hilary\nThanks for your response and your readiness to work with me on this matter. First and foremost, let me reassure you, that this is a 100% legal transaction. People around the world claim on their late relatives estate on a daily basis and this is just one of such claims - only this time, you are not related with the deceased and working with a bank insider (me), who was the deceased account officer.\nI will provide you, with all relevant documents and guide you through the claim process and we share the funds at a 50/50 ratio after claim. I will guide you through the probate application and the only thing, that can fuck this deal is, if at any point during the claim process, you open up to somebody and my bank gets to know, that you are not related to the deceased depositor. That will not only ruin my career, but might as well earn me some jail time for misrepresentation/falsification of information, to defraud the bank. Other than that, if you agree to work with me, and keep this transaction confidential, we can claim these funds in less than 10 banking days, if you follow instructions and do as I tell you. So, for a start, you have to give me your full details:\n* Full name\n* Age or Date of birth\n* Occupation\n* Address\n* Telephone number/WhatsApp\nThe process is simple, it starts with a false alarm to my colleagues, that a relative of the deceased contacted me and I have asked you, to send an email. I will give you a text draft, that you will send to the appropriate Dept., once you send the email, I will check and find your name in our file, which I have already created with above details, which I will submit for approval. Then you go through probate, to get a letter of administration (I will guide you, on how to go about that) and submit it to the bank and direct them to transfer the funds to your designated bank account. The funds are currently in a suspense account with our bank Banque Atlantique Group, Abidjan.\nI will guide you with more details, when you reply to this mail. The only area, I might need your financial assistance is in the legal fees. We need a \"Letter of Administration\" from the Court\nand a lawyer is required, to file the \"Affidavit of Death\" to the Probate Court, to obtain the \"Letter of Administration\".\nThis will cost some money and that's the only area, I will be needing your assistance, which I am certain, that both of us can handle, without any difficulties.
