Without wasting much time, I have personally investigated this payment down to the Ministry where this contract was executed and from my findings it is clear that you did not execute this contract in question, from all available information, it looks like some officials in the Ministry were trying to use you to claim this particular value which they over invoiced for their own selfish interest. I know it might interest you to know how I managed to find out this truth, yes. I investigated this payment up to the ministry where this contract was executed and after some checks I was surprised to see that the most vital/important documents regarding this contract bear a different name and beneficiary.\nBased on this I decide to contact the supervisor that signed the attestation report, on getting to the contract award and supervisory commission I collected the contract attestation report and found out that this document still bears the name: B&B PETROLEUM ENG.PTY as the company that executed this contract. I kept this to myself and came down to my base. As a matter of fact I have been thinking if to report my findings to the appropriate body for cancellation of this payment, but I have this second thought of contacting you since I am not a saint and in a position to approve this payment for the president to give go ahead order to the release, I feel this might be a Gods given opportunity.\nSo based on this I am writing to you, if you will accept my  conditions I can normalize all the relevant papers of this payment and the funds will be released within 14 working days. Contract attestation report is not in your name, the fund ownership certificate is also not in your name. Actually your partners, as I should say, did a very great job in manipulating almost all the documents to your favor.\nNow, I want you to know that, with my position, I can amend this problem and this money will be paid to your nominated bank account which both of us will share on a 50/50 %if only you will accept my conditions. So, if you see it wise to get this perfected with me feel free.\nI shall let you know my conditions as soon as I hear from you.\nThanks.\nMary Egbu\nChairLady Payment Verification Panel\n", "From: g*******r@gmail.com\nTo: od67496@l******s.email\nTime: 2023-04-11 19:16:02\nSUBJECT: Clear picture\nGreetings\nEmail received, concerns noted.\nThis transaction is %100 risk free.\nPlan is simple.
