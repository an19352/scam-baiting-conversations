My late husband died on an airline crash, in the year February 2010, During his lifetime he deposited the sum of ($11,000,000.00 Dollars).In the bank  The money was from the sale of his company and death benefits payment and entitlements of my late husband by his company. I am sending you this message with heavy tears in my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, and also praying that it will reach you in good health because I am not in good health, I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am suffering from long time cancer and presently I am partially suffering from Leprosy, which has become difficult for me to move around. I was married to my late husband for more than 6 years without having a child. And my doctor just confirmed to me that I have less chance to live, having to know when the cup of death will come, I decided to contact you to claim the fund since I don't have any relation.I grew up from an orphanage home, I have decided to donate this money for the support of helping Motherless babies, Less privileged/Widows and churches also to build the house of God because I am dying and diagnosed with cancer for about 3 years ago. I have decided to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you, for the good work of Almighty God. I will be going in for an operation surgery soon,Now I want you to stand as my next of kin to claim the funds for charity purposes. Because if this money remains unclaimed after my death, the bank executives or the government will take the money as unclaimed fund and maybe use it for selfishness and worthless ventures, I need a very honest person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also build schools and churches for less privilege that will be named after my late husband and my name.
