I inherited this money from my late\nhusband. Mr Smith Adam  And I don\u2019t know how much the accurate\ninterest on the money for the past few years the money has been lying\nin the custody of the Bank. 15 million dollars, I have made up my\nmind to entrust the fund in your care to be distributed to charitable\norganisation in any country that mostly need some support and to\nother. I want the money to reach the less privileged in the society,\nespecially the motherless children, the orphans and the handicapped. I\nintended to keep the money for my adopted child but unfortunately, my\nadopted child got involved in a bus accident while returning back from\nschool and he died. I finally made up my mind to donate out this fund\nafter being diagnosed of cancer by my doctor. That was few months ago.\nRecently, my doctor insisted that I must go for surgical operation, or\nelse, it would get to uncontrollable stage. He also made me to\nunderstand that my chances of surviving the operation would be 50/50\nand that the surgery operation must be done. Based on that, I decided\nthat I have to WILL off the fund to the suffering children first\nbefore going for the operation\nIn view of the above, I want you to assure me that you are going to\nutilize this money that I am about to entrust in your care, that the\nmoney would not be used in some other things that are not in line with\nwhat I have proposed for the money. Please, I want you to write back\nto me and acknowledge to me that the money must be used judiciously.\nOnce I receive your response to this message, and if your vision\ntowards this project is acceptable with me, I shall then put you in\ncontact with my late husband\u2019s lawyer who is going to work hand in\nhand with you for transfer of the money to you, because i may not be\nable to communicate again once am placed on medical supervision for my\noperation.
