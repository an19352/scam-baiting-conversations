How are you and members of your family? I hope this finds you all well.\nI am Mr. Joseph Scott, the Senior Operations Manager, Bank of America and I am contacting you based on my capacity as the officer in charge in respect of the will left in your name by late Mr. Andersen, whose demise occurred on the 26th April 2021. He was a customer in my bank (Bank Of America) and he (late Mr. Andersen) deposited the sum of US$5M in my bank in the year 2013 and i have the photocopies of his fund's documents and will send it to you via email attachment to apply to my bank as the next of kin to the deceased person.\nLate Mr. Andersen,  lived in Scotland. Just like I had feared, my efforts to trace his family members were unsuccessful since there was inadequate or rather, no information left by him about his family members. For two years (from 2021 till now). I have invested both time and money in my quest to trace his family tree but all my efforts have been futile.\nMy resolving to engage this measure to secure the notice from my bank in June 2023 that they will be effecting confiscation action on his account if there is non-appearance of a beneficiary before the end of June 2023. As a matter of fact, banking policy governing suspended accounts empowers the bank to confiscate his funds and remit it as residual to the government deposit account after 5 to 10 years as unclaimed or owner-less funds.\nYou may or may not be related to Mr. Andersen. However, that is my least concern at the moment. I have contacted you because you share the same last name with him and my intention is to present you to the bank as the bona fide beneficiary to his account after procuring and obtaining due legal documentation in the Courts.\nYou may be wondering how I would be able to fortify and consummate this deal but make no mistake; I have not insinuated that achieving this objective will be easy and simple. But all I can assure you is that with a proper and careful handling that we will come out successful.\nPrior to sending you this email I have planned how best to execute this transaction and trust me, you can count on my proficiency. Let me remind you that this transaction will be conducted under legal procedural (LAW) to preclude us from infringement. Therefore, no atom of Risks or Consequences, legal or otherwise shall be met in the process of executing this matter hence our legal rights and protection shall be preserved prior and after receiving the fund.\nIn respect to the sharing, I have resolved a mutual sharing of 40% for you while 50% for me and the remaining 10% will be an unforeseen expenses that may occur during the funds processing / transfer. However this will be engraved in an agreement that both of us will sign to protect our interest, individually.\nPlease, if you have read, understood and are willing to cooperate with me to consummate this transaction please kindly let me know so that I will send you the photo copies of the funds documents.\nYou are hereby advised to provide me your information's such as:\n*Int'l Passport or Drivers License for proper identification\n*Full Name:\n*Official address:\n*Telephone number:\n*Age declaration\n*Occupation\n*Bank Account to receive this US$5M\nContact me on my direct email address for further clarification: \nscotjoseph595@gmail.com\nLooking forward to your swift response.\nRegards,\nMr. Joseph Scot    \n", "From: s***********5@gmail.com\nTo: hr89230@l******s.email\nTime: 2023-04-28 17:59:50\nSUBJECT: Joe Scott ID\nDear Crystal,\nThanks for your most honest mail.
