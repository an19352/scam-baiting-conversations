I appreciate your concern regarding the power of attorney claiming that I am deceased and that my funds are unclaimed. However, I can assure you that I am very much alive and have not authorized anyone to act on my behalf.\nI would like to know more about this matter, such as the source of the power of attorney and how it was obtained. I am also interested in learning more about the process for claiming my funds and what steps I need to take to ensure that my personal information is secure.\nWhile I am happy to provide you with my bank account details, telephone number, and address, I am hesitant to share my passport or driver's license without more information about the legitimacy of this claim.\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.\nBest wishes,\nKevin\n", "direction": "Outbound"}, {"time": "1681392653", "subject": "SUBJECT: Re: From The Desk Of The Executi", "body": "We are going to use the information to get all the documents on your behalf which the lawyers will do.
