I need your assurance that those colleagues will be totally kept out of this transaction. I know that none of them are aware of my new approach to you. Stop spending your money unnecessarily to any of those Officers both here and overseas because you will not receive this money without my hand in it. I personally did the work at the beginning and only I can diligently complete the pending funds.\nFinally, I need your promise that no official of those Banks you have contacted before will be aware of my involvement in this regard because of my position. Now re-assure me that you will be willing to compensate me and that you will assist my wife to establish a foreign account in your country where my compensation will be lodged.\nI am a man of my word.
