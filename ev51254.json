I hope with this explanation\nyou will understand better my purpose of contacting you please read\ncarefully and patiently.\nIn June 2015, one of our foreign customers made a Fixed deposit for 36\ncalendar months, valued at US$35,500,000.00 in our bank where l am head of\naccounts department.\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but\ngot no reply. After waiting several months, we sent a reminder and finally\ndiscovered from his contract employers that he and his family died in a\nplane crash.\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without leaving a WILL\nand all attempts to trace extended members of his family were never\nsuccessful. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he\ndid not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents\nin his Bank Deposit paperwork at my Bank.\nHis money (US$35,000,000.00 ) has been floating as unclaimed since maturity\nand all efforts to get his relatives have proved unsuccessful. According to\nour banking policy, if such money continues to remain unclaimed, the money\nwill be passed to the coffers of the Central bank treasury unclaimed bill.\nIt's been many years now and nobody has shown up for the money. My proposal\nto you is that l want you to cooperate with me to enable us to claim the\nmoney so we can both use it for investment . I will put all the necessary\ndocuments together to make you the next of kin so that the money will be\npaid to you. I have secured from the probate court an order of mandamus to\nlocate any family member of the deceased so that the money can be paid to\nhim or her, but still no success.\nIf you agree to cooperate with me, after successful execution of this deal,\nwe shall share the money in percentage of 50/50. I assure you that this\ndeal is 100% risk free, you don't have to fear anything as l am a\nprofessional in Real Estate Banking / Family Wealth\nIf you are interested in engaging in this deal, please respond in earliest\nupon reception of this message so I can confidently explain to you more\nThank you.\nSincerely yours,\nJJ Kwame.\n", "From: d********4@gmail.com\nTo: ev51254@l******s.email\nTime: 2023-04-21 11:17:16\nSUBJECT: Re: Hello,\nDear Alberto,\nThanks for your response. First and foremost, let me reassure you that this\nis a 100% legal transaction. People around the world claim on their late\nrelatives estate on a daily basis and this is just one of such claims -\nonly this time, you are not related with the deceased and working with a\nbank insider (me) who was the deceased account officer. I will provide you\nwith all relevant documents and guide you through the claim process and we\nshare the funds at a 50/50 ratio after claim. I will guide you through the\nprobate application and the only thing that can fuck this deal is if at any\npoint during the claim process you open up to somebody and my bank gets to\nknow that you are not related to the deceased depositor.\nThat will not only ruin my career but might as well earn me some jail time\nfor misrepresentation/falsification of information to defraud the bank.\nOther than that, if you agree to work with me and keep this transaction\nconfidential, we can claim these funds in less than 10 banking days if you\nfollow instructions and do as I tell you.
