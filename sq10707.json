Garki Abuja\nGreetings Dear Unpaid Beneficiary,\nThis is to inform you that in the course of my investigation as\ndirector of payment verification / implementation committee I came\nacross your name as unpaid fund beneficiary in the record of the\ncentral bank of Nigeria and other banks that are supposed to get your\nfunds released to you. My committee was set up by the payment\nreconciliation committee to verify and scrutinize all outstanding\ndebts owed to our foreign beneficiaries in accordance to the\ninformation received from the United States government and other\ncountries over unpaid huge debts owed to Foreigners.\nHaving seen your file and my further questioning to the officials of\nthe central Nigeria bank and ministry of finance as to why your\npayment is still pending reveals the rot and corruption in the system.\nThe bank officials told me that the reason why you haven't received\nyour payment is due to your inability to pay for the required charges\nfor transfer of funds to your account. When I asked them why they\ndidn't deduct the said charges from your principal sum, I was given\nthe flimsy excuse that you never authorized them to do so. When I put\nthe question across to them if they ever advised you that such charges\ncould be deducted from your principal fund,the answer I got was no.\nNow, if you do not tell this beneficiary that such charges could be\ndeducted from his or her principal fund, how will he or she know that\nsuch options are available for such beneficiaries.\nFrom my investigation I discovered that these bank officials\ndeliberately refused to let the charges be deducted from your\nprincipal fund because they want your fund to remain trapped in the\nbank, while they continue to extort money from beneficiaries under\nsome flimsy excuse. You do not need to pay any money to any official,\nall you are required to do is swear an affidavit at the federal high\ncourt of Nigeria, authorizing the bank to deduct all charges from your\nprincipal fund and transfer the balance of funds after deduction to\nyour bank account. If you have spent any money in the past in your\nquest for payment, kindly let me know so that I can follow this up.\nYou get back to me immediately in my email for a directive on how you\ncan get the deduction done as soon as possible and get your payment\nalso.\nYours sincerely,\nOlukayode Ariwoola GCON\nNew Chief Justice of Nigeria\nEmail:-olukayodeariwoolagcon110@mail.com   \n", "From: o**********************0@mail.com\nTo: sq10707@l******s.email\nTime: 2023-04-11 16:51:23\nSUBJECT: Re: Supreme Court of Nigeria\nSupreme Court of Nigeria \nThree-Arms Zone \nP.M.B. 308.
