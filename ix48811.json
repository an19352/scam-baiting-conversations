Length of Loan:                         10 years + (TBC)\nMoratorium on Interest:               0 to 36 months possible\nRepayment:                                 At end of loan period\n(which can be extended by mutual agreement) or pay back early the amount\nof the Loan in minimum tranches of USD 500,000 without penalty.\nInterest Rate:                                    2.5% per annum\nLegal Jurisdiction:                             International\nRegarding the Insurance Bond Guarantee - no other collateral, personal \nguarantee of share pledge is required. The Insurance Bond is put in \nplace as the surety / security for the loan. In the instance (after \n\"default notification\" and \"failure to remedy\") that a loan could \npotentially fully default the Insurance Bond is triggered in favor of \nthe lender and pays back the majority of their loan. For the balance \nthere is then a company valuation done on the Borrowers and Lender can \ntrigger step-in rights for a proportion of the company shares. But this \nis a last resort always. The one off cost is 3% of the loan and is \ndeducted from the loan amount and not required to be provided separately \nby the Borrower.\nAs with all lenders there are some fees ahead of drawdown that cannot be \navoided or deferred.
