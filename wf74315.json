I have been a member of the Scotiabank Board of\nDirectors since 2016.\nI firmly feel that God has placed you in my path at this precise moment.\nYou will find this crucial business conversation interesting since you will\ngain from it, so I want to share it with you.\nThe estate of a respected client and friend who passed away recently is\nbeing administered by me, and it is estimated to be worth $77,000,000.00\n(seventy seven million USD).\nAlthough he selected me as executor, knowing full well that I would have\nthe authority to make any choices in the event of a sudden death, there was\napparently no mention of an heir or next of kin in any of the estate\nproject agreements with the bank from the outset.\nKnowing him for years, the fact that he never married, never had children,\nnever introduced any form of family to me or the bank until his passing\nleft me in a precarious and perplexed situation. The bank management asked\nthe executor to provide instructions last week regarding what to do with\nthe decedent's abandoned estate. As his executor, I am not permitted by law\nto inherit from, divert from, or claim this estate or any of its assets,\nbut I am permitted to make decisions on whoever I deem to be a reasonably\ncompetent and capable claimant.\nI contacted you and am now requesting your cooperation to present you for\nthe claim as a trustee because I have been looking for the ideal\nbusiness-minded individual to share this ideas with and possibly present\nthe individual for the claim. If I am unable to find a deserving individual\nfor the claim, my bank's board of directors will not hesitate to divert the\nfunds to their own selfish uses. Since the transaction will be carried out\nin accordance with a valid agreement that will safeguard you from any\nrisks, there is no risk involved. Since the bank directors are already\nwealthy, it is preferable for us to take possession of the funds than to\nlet them do so. I don't have a greedy nature, so I propose splitting the\nmoney 50/50 between the two parties. My share will help me to make a\ndifference in the lives of many people who are dying, and I know the\nasset's owner would be happy if it wasn't mishandled or used for my own\ngain.\nAs soon as you let me know what you think about this, I'll reply with more\ninformation about the next steps in my response. Please keep this a secret\nbetween the two of us only until everything is formally arranged.\nPlease reply\nGod bless you, and have a good day.\n", "direction": "Inbound"}, {"time": "1682316796", "subject": "SUBJECT: Re: Happy New Week", "body": "Hello Scott,\nThank you for reaching out to me.
