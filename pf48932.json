The diplomat's inability to\npay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the\nconsignment is delayed and abandoned.\nBy my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more. They are\nstill left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments\nlike I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 110kg each (Internal\ndimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective Capacity: 680 L) Approximately.\nThe details of the consignment including your name and email on the\nofficial document from United Nations' office in London where the shipment\nwas tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with\nus.

It is now left to you to decide if you still need\nthe consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK (place of origin) as\nwe were instructed.\nLike I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most\nimportantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the\nyellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s) etc. I\nam ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages\nprovided you will also give me something out of it (financial\ngratification).
